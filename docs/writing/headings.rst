Headings
========

Readers use the table of contents or scan through the headings to find the
required content. Therefore, headings must reflect the information that the
readers search. The documentation includes the following types of
headings:

* Section titles
* Topic titles
* Figure and table titles

General guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following guidelines for all types of headings:

* Use sentence-style capitalization except for the Operations Guide, which
  follows the `O'Reilly heading capitalization style <http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000969/ch02.html#headings>`_,
  and book titles.
* Make headings brief but descriptive.
* Use articles in titles, but do not start the title with an article.
* Avoid using uncommon abbreviations.
* Do not end a title with a period or colon.
* Add some introductory text between two headings that go directly after each
  other.


Section titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write the section title in gerund where possible.

**Examples:**

with a verb in gerund or a noun.
