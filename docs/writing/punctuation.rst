     - How to use
     - Example

   * - Serial (Oxford) comma
     - Use comma before the *and* and *or* conjunctions that connect items
       in series of three or more.
     - You can create, update, and delete roles.

   * - Semicolon
     - Avoid using semicolons in sentences. Use periods or a commas instead.
       Use semicolons only to separate series of words separated by commas.
     - Large, medium, or small; soft or hard; black, gray, or white.

   * - Colon
     - Use colons to introduce lists and code examples or tables where
       needed. Do not use colons in headings if this is not explicitly
       required. Typically, use lowercase letters after colons
       in running text.
     - The configuration values are:

       * ``certfile``
       * ...

   * - Quotation marks
     - Generally, avoid using quotation marks, use the corresponding markup
       instead.

       Though, if the quotation marks are required, place commas and periods
       inside closing quotation marks.
       This applies to both words-as-words and sentence fragments.
     - The screen displays, "Hello, world."
